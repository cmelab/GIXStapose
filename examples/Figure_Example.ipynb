    "Imagine, you've just finished running a parameter sweep of 10 different temperatures, 10 different pressures, and 10 different compounds. You've used a GUI (perhaps the GIXStapose GUI!) for chemical structure visualization and painstakenly rotated and zoomed to create some really nice figures--it took you a day and a half, but now you're ready to add these figures to your publication. However, when you show the figures you made to your advisor, she asks for a view from a different angle and using a different color scheme...\n",

In this diffraction pattern, the wave vectors pointing to these yellow/green peak centers can be used to derive average lamellar spacings that would be a mess to deduce from the direct visualization. This example showcases how looking at chemical structures through the diffraction lens *first* can identify periodic features that may not be immediately visible to the eye. Once we know a periodic feature exists, we can pull up the chemical structure visualization and look for features at the expected length scales. We can also use this orientation as a reference point to generate a sequence of rotations that reveal other structures (e.g., for you P3HT experts, an orientation that more clearly reveals the spacing of the pi-pi stacking of the P3HT backbones)."
